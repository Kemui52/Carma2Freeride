# Carmageddon 2: Freeride Maps

Because I assume Joyride would already have been taken. This is a collection of game files to support driving around the maps with no objective, as well as a few personal edits to make rampages easier and more enjoyable.

A readme will be included in each folder to explain what each file does and what other files they might need.

## Installation Tips

The files line up with the game directory, but the text files in the data folder won't be acknowledged by the game unless you remove the two ``Data.TWT`` files. Those are archives, though, so you must extract their contents to the data folder or get them from the Vanilla C2 Mini-Pack.

This is set up like a manual installation, so you are encouraged to read the Readme in each directory to get a quick summary on what each file does and what it relies on. For example, my ``RACES.TXT`` is linked with a heavily rearranged ``POWERUP.TXT`` to restrict the available powerups to a select few that I'm interested in. If you want the powerups unchanged, you will need to modify some lines in ``RACES.TXT`` and refrain from installing the ``POWERUP.TXT``.

## Known Issues

I forgot one of the known issues.

Using the solid granite cheat with the dump truck tends to crash the game after a short while. This makes me sad... It's always so hard to find a game with a giant dump truck and no caveats.
