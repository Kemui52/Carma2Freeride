With my EXE edit, cheat mode is activated with:
WetWet

The powerup keys I rearranged by editing the POWERUP.TXT are:
2 Solid Granite
3 Mini Peds
4 Giant Peds
5 Explosive Peds
6 Dismemberfest
7 Slowmo Peds
8 Kangaroo
9 Powerup Canceller

The other powerup keys will only award credits since my free maps disable them by default. You can edit RACES.TXT to allow them again.
The cheat keys on F6, F8, etc. are unaffected and still functional.
