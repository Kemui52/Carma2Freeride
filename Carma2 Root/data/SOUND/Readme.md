# Sound Folder

## SOUND.TXT

Optional file that contains minor edits to sounds that I felt needed improvement. I couldn't stand that certain sounds reminded me of other games that used the same ones. I also muted some powerup noises that I thought were distracting. I refined the reindeer impact sound, too, since it originally played its sounds back to back instead of simultaneously.

All edits in this file should be marked with ``--kemui changed`` in case you wanted to merge any changes with your own file.
