# Data Folder

## RACES.TXT

This is what sets up the free maps. Absolutely requires the RACES folder in order to function.

This file is linked with the heavily rearranged ``POWERUP.TXT`` file to restrict the available powerups to a select few that I'm interested in. If you want the powerups unchanged, you will need to modify the powerup lines in ``RACES.TXT`` and refrain from installing the ``POWERUP.TXT``. Replace each long line of numbers marked as "Powerup exclusions" in the ``RACES.TXT`` with a single -1 to enable all powerups.

## POWERUP.TXT

Rearranges the powerups so ones I want to use are easily accessible from the number keys in cheat mode. I also edited those ones to last forever or grant many uses.

## FreerideSave.ce2

This is an exported save slot with all cars and missions available. Use [Carmeditor 2 v0.203](https://rr2000.cwaboard.co.uk/pc-files) to import it to your ``savedgames.ars``.
